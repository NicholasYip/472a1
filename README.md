To run our application, we must first install all the dependencies that are required. To do so, uncomment 
```# install packages by running pip install -r requirements.txt```
in ```main.py``` file located in the ‘src’ folder. Then, we can run main.py.  

Our static folder contains all the performances summary for our experiment and the plot distribution for our dataset in part 1.


The file main.py contains all the code which answers all the questions asked. As for question 2.5, see part2_5_different_split_1.py and part2_5_different_split_2.py for our own exploration of different training and test batches. Run the two files mentioned previously to get their performance summary.

For question 3.8, see part3_8_different_model_1.py and part3_8_different_model_2.py for our own exploration using other embeddings pre-trained models. Run the two files mentioned previously to get their performance summary.
